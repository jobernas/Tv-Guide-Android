Dynamic TV Guide for Android Sample

This project is a simple demo of a TV Guide. The channels are created dynamically
when you scroll down also the schedules are created dynamically when you scroll horizontally.
This way you avoid overloading the Device with several static views that you don't need.

For this project you need Horizontal Listview Library from MeetMe (https://github.com/MeetMe/Android-HorizontalListView)
with a few changes to make the horizontal scroll sync possible.

Enjoy :)
